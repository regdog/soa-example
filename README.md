SOA in Rails - a complete example
=================================

So you want to create a new Rails application based on a Service Oriented Architecture, or (much more likely) you want to split up an existing, large, Rails application into smaller more maintainable services?

This application is a small example based on the techniques illusrated in 
in [Service Oriented Design in Rails](http://books.google.co.jp/books/about/Service_Oriented_Design_with_Ruby_and_Ra.html?id=TL4iQwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y).
